# some thoughts
## it's been a long time
...and in that time i've been deliberating over the directions in which to take this project. 
i've  been considering looking at both the composition and demographics of artists...
...but i feel like demographics would be more relevant as much as i am personally fascinated by the technicalities of trance music composition. 

in addition, in my time on hiatus from this space, i have also been considering creating a database with my favourite anjunabeats tracks- 
unsure if i'd want to display them as a web-page or just have an API of favourites. 
or, have a data visualisation of attributes of my favourites with a corresponding API. 

anyways, i haven't progressed much on gathering and cleaning the data on all of the anjunabeats tracks/compilations since the fall when i wrote this- 
but it's gonna be something that i should finish up soon with the upcoming break.
