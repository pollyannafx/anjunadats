A project started 15 April 2024 in which I attempt to track trends in the releases of one (1) British trance music record label. 
Turns out that looking at one music label...really says a lot about said music's development? 

_heck yeah._ taking a look at anjunabeats (the label in question) can tell me a _lot_ about where trance music has gone and where it's going. 
like, it's a peek into how the nature and purpose of trance music has evolved over time. and electronic music in general. Somehow, 'trance' has gone 
from some sort of heavenly refuge from worldly pain (religious connotation intended) to a more listenable alternative to big room EDM to an experimental space whose output is ironically very manicured. 

This project will study both the composition of the tracks and the demographics of the artists.
A more in-depth description of the project's aims, disclaimers about how the data was collected, and anecdotes about my unfortunate obsession with older trance music will be included in the final report. 
If everything goes to plan. 

i'm sorry that i haven't been posting any work in real time about i just remembered github existed

[09/28/2024] and now that i'm using github more for school, maybe i'll remember it exists more! 
i love markdown. 

[03/21/2025] waiting on the permission of anjunabeats HQ to scrape some of their data. i was collecting data manually when i started this project in 2024, but now i have more expertise in using larger datasets.
